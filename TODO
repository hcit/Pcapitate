* --kill-untitled should imply --get-titles, duh!

* an option to filter out requests that are extremely close together to make
  the output closer to a real browser history (fewer stylesheet grabs, images,
  javascript, and other automatic stuff shown)

* an option to include src and/or dst IPs in output

* more tests would be nice...
