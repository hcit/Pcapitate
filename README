PCAPITATE
=========

This tool parses raw packet capture data (from tcpdump, wireshark, etc.) and
formats it nicely into a semi-real browser history. This makes snooping on
people a much more pleasant experience!

It uses dpkt to read the capture data, so any pcap-compatible output should be
hunky dory (in theory -- I've only run very limited tests so far).


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* Python (no shit)
* dpkt
* argparse (standard with Python 2.7+)


USAGE
-----
Just pass it a pcap file and it will spit output to stdout for you to have your
way with. It has the following command line options:

--output-html
    Output in HTML instead of plaintext. A little prettier, a little easier to
    navigate.

--get-titles
    Fetch current page titles using urllib2 (this can take some time, so be
    patient). This just makes the output a little bit more useful.

--kill-untitled
    Don't included untitled pages in the output. This can be a neat way to
    filter out dumb requests like JS, CSS, stupid ads, etc. Though you always
    run the risk that someone will view a valid page without a <title>...
